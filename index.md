# How to use Sarah Class App

The main concepts are **lessons** and **notes**. 

Lessons are initiated by the teacher and received by the student. A lesson consists 
of a task for the student to undertake. Within a lesson the student sends notes to the teacher 
and the teacher reply to the student notes until the lesson is completed. 
A note is a text message but can include a document attachment, a picture and an audio message.
