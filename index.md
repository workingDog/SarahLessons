# How to use Sarah Class App

The main concepts are **lessons** and **notes**. 

Lessons are initiated by the teacher and received by the student. A lesson consists 
of a task for the student to undertake. Within a lesson the student sends notes to the teacher 
and the teacher reply to the student notes until the lesson is completed. 
A note is a text message but can include a document attachment, an audio message and pictures.

When **Sarah Class App** is first launched, a demo student account is presented. 
This account is used only to highlight the main features of the app. 
The email is **demostudent@example.com** and password **demostudent**.

After contacting the teacher a specific account for you will be created. 
To sign in enter your email and the password sent to you.
